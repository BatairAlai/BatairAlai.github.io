I want to post a Road Map some time within the next week. I have a new, full-time assignment that I was given so I won't have as much time to do studying/building for a bit. Plus, I'll be taking part in an asthma research study. It's nothing serious, it's just some things that'll take up more time for the next month or so. I want to come back with a strong plan and not wonder what I need to do when I don't have an assignment.

Also, I hope that job I was told about that may/may not be available in a city close to me is still in the air. I'd rather it be something that may happen versus not happening at all. It's been tumble weeds in this part of the communication and I'm a bit nervous to ask. I'll give my recruiter a call tomorrow. It'd be great to have a steady job to study without having to worry if I should be putting my efforts elsewhere or second-guessing my spare time. It's exhausting.
