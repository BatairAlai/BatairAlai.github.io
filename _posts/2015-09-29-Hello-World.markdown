So as well as doing [The Odin Project][odin], I will be brushing up on a couple of courses that I put aside on [Udemy][udemy], and tackle some projects that I want to build which I have just mock ups of. It's all fleshed out between being written down and digitally designed. I just need to build them before the design process of these ideas overwhelm me. 

In the process of going through Udemy and The Odin Project, I am doing a base skill test to determine what I am comfortable with, what languages skills I'll need to have after the curriculums, or ask for help on a project if it's well beyond my abilities. I know for the main project I want to make I will need to know how to build webscraping tools, in-app multi-user input/feedback, profile creation/saving, persistent input fields, and a whole bevvy of other things.

I'm really excited and I knew that I had to build a site in order to keep me on track. I have a much better idea of where I need to go in terms of what I've accomplished before. I will be tinkering with the site while I build/study.
